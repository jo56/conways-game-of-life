# Conway's Game of Life â€” React + TypeScript


Quick start:


1. npm install
2. npm run dev


This project uses Vite + React + TypeScript. The primary app is `src/App.tsx` (default export component). The canvas is responsive; use the controls to start/stop, step, randomize, and clear the simulation.


Keyboard shortcuts are included for convenience.
